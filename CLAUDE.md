# Claude.md - Project Context for AI Assistance

## 🚧 CURRENT WORK IN PROGRESS

**Next Task**: Create `src/data/classSpells.ts` to connect spells to classes in SpellSelector

**Problem**: SpellSelector.tsx only has hardcoded Warlock spells. Other classes show "Spell Selection Unavailable".

**Solution needed**:
1. Create `src/data/classSpells.ts` with properly typed `Spell` objects for each class
2. Export arrays: `BARD_CANTRIPS`, `BARD_LEVEL_1_SPELLS`, `CLERIC_CANTRIPS`, etc.
3. Export helper: `getClassSpells(classId: string, level: number)`
4. Update `SpellSelector.tsx` to import from classSpells.ts instead of hardcoded arrays

**Spell interface required** (from `src/types/spell.ts`):
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  level: number, // 0 for cantrips
  school: 'abjuration' | 'conjuration' | 'divination' | 'enchantment' | 'evocation' | 'illusion' | 'necromancy' | 'transmutation',
  castingTime: { amount: number, unit: 'action' | 'bonusAction' | 'reaction' | 'minute' | 'hour' },
  range: { type: 'self' | 'touch' | 'ranged', distance?: number },
  components: { verbal: boolean, somatic: boolean, material: boolean, materialDescription?: string },
  duration: { type: 'instantaneous' | 'concentration' | 'timed', amount?: number, unit?: 'round' | 'minute' | 'hour' },
  ritual: boolean,
  concentration: boolean,
  classes: string[]
}
```

**Classes needing spells**:
- Full casters (cantrips + spells): Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
- Half casters (spells only): Paladin, Ranger
- Custom classes: Death Knight, Necromancer, Demon Hunter, Amazon

**Reference**: 401 spells exist in `src/data/quickReference.ts` as `SpellRef` type (string-based), but SpellSelector needs structured `Spell` type objects.

## Current Project Status (Updated Feb 2026)

### What's Already Built

**Tech Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Zustand

**Completed Data References** (in `src/data/quickReference.ts`):
- ✅ **401 Spells** - Complete PHB 2024 spell list (cantrips through 9th level)
- ✅ **6 Abilities** - STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA with descriptions
- ✅ **18 Skills** - All skills with ability associations
- ✅ **37 Weapons** - Simple and martial weapons with stats
- ✅ **13 Armor** - Light, medium, heavy armor and shields
- ✅ **14 Conditions** - Blinded, charmed, frightened, etc.
- ✅ **100+ Class Traits** - Features for all classes/subclasses
- ✅ **30+ Game Rules** - Clickable references for new players (spellcasting, combat, rests)

**Completed Classes** (12 classes, 28 subclasses):
- Barbarian (4 subclasses), Bard (4), Cleric (7 domains), Druid (3)
- Fighter (5), Monk (4), Paladin (4), Ranger (4)
- Rogue (4), Sorcerer (4), Warlock (4 patrons), Wizard (8 schools)

**Completed Races**: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Tiefling, Dragonborn, Drow, Aasimar, Goliath, Tabaxi, Kenku, Firbolg, Lizardfolk, Triton, Tortle

**Completed Feats**: 18 feats including Alert, GWM, Sentinel, Lucky, etc.

**UI Components Built**:
- QuickRefTooltip - Clickable references that show popups
- Character creation flow (partial)
- Dice roller
- Inventory system with currency

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/data/quickReference.ts` | Main data file - spells, skills, weapons, armor, conditions, traits, rules |
| `src/components/QuickRefTooltip.tsx` | Clickable reference popup component |
| `src/stores/characterStore.ts` | Zustand store for character state |

### Important Notes

- **Spell levels go 0-9** (cantrips to 9th), NOT 1-20. Character levels go 1-20.
- **PHB 2024** is the target ruleset, not older 5e versions
- **New player focused** - all references should be beginner-friendly with examples
- Build with `npm run build` - must pass TypeScript checks

## Project Overview

**Dungeons** is a browser-based D&D 5th Edition (2024) DM tool and character creation system. The goal is "click and create" - users should be able to build complete, playable characters with minimal effort while DMs can manage entire campaigns from a single interface.

### Core Vision
- **Simple character creation** with intuitive page-by-page flow
- **Full keyboard navigation** (Tab/Shift+Tab support throughout)
- **DM Campaign Management** - track all party characters in one place
- **Instant access** to character sheets, spells, and skills via internal links
- **Comprehensive dice rolling** with modifier support

## Target Ruleset

**D&D 5th Edition 2024 Player's Handbook** - All classes and races will eventually be supported.

### Initial Development Focus
1. **Fighter (Ranger subclass) + Drow** - Primary focus
2. **Warlock (Great Old One subclass) + Tiefling** - Secondary focus

## Architecture Decisions

- **Browser-based**: Pure web application, works in all modern browsers
- **Data-driven design**: Classes, races, spells, and equipment defined in JSON files
- **Page-based flow**: Each major choice is its own page/view
- **Keyboard-first**: Full Tab/Shift+Tab navigation, Enter to confirm
- **Offline-capable**: Works without internet, syncs when available
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target

## Character Creation Flow

### Page 1: Character Details
Text input fields with Tab/Shift+Tab navigation:
- Character Name (required)
- Age
- Height
- Weight

- **Roll**: 4d6 drop lowest (with dice animation)

Racial bonuses applied automatically.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused (<100 lines ideal)
- Use descriptive variable names (no abbreviations)
- Comment complex game rule calculations
- Write unit tests for all calculation utilities
- Ensure full keyboard accessibility

## Common Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run test         # Run test suite
npm run lint         # Check code style
npm run type-check   # Verify TypeScript types
```

## Resources

- [D&D 5e 2024 PHB](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) - Official 2024 rules
- [5e.tools](https://5e.tools/) - Community rules database
- Player's Handbook 2024 - Primary source for class/race details

## Notes for Claude

When working on this project:
1. Always validate against 5e 2024 rules when implementing features
2. Prioritize keyboard navigation - Tab/Shift+Tab must work everywhere
3. Keep accessibility in mind for all UI components
4. Test dice calculations thoroughly - randomness must be fair
5. Internal links should be consistent and always functional
6. When in doubt about rules, ask for clarification
